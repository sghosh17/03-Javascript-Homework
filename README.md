## Week 03 Homework

This project involves enhancing an existing code so that the code generates a password based on the various criterias selected. As part of enhancing the code, I have updated the existing script.js file by writing a new fuction to generate a random password. 

Within the function I did the follwing steps:

* Used prompts to take the password length as user input.

* Used confirm dialogs to confirm the user inputs for the various criterias.

* Based on the various options selected by the user, a number of operations are performed -

            *   Validation on the password length.
            *   Concatenation based on the various combinations of the criterias selected.   
 
* At the end a random password is generated using the random function.

* Displaying the generated password in the designated textarea of the index.html file.
